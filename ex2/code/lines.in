In
mathematics
and
computer
science,
dynamic
programming
is
a
method
for
solving
complex
problems
by
breaking
them
down
into
simpler
subproblems.
It
is
applicable
to
problems
exhibiting
the
properties
of
overlapping
subproblems
which
are
only
slightly
smaller
and
optimal
substructure
(described
below).
When
applicable,
the
method
takes
far
less
time
than
naive
methods.
The
key
idea
behind
dynamic
programming
is
quite
simple.
In
general,
to
solve
a
given
problem,
we
need
to
solve
different
parts
of
the
problem
(subproblems),
then
combine
the
solutions
of
the
subproblems
to
reach
an
overall
solution.
Often,
many
of
these
subproblems
are
really
the
same.
The
dynamic
programming
approach
seeks
to
solve
each
subproblem
only
once,
thus
reducing
the
number
of
computations.
This
is
especially
useful
when
the
number
of
repeating
subproblems
is
exponentially
large.
Top-down
dynamic
programming
simply
means
storing
the
results
of
certain
calculations,
which
are
later
used
again
since
the
completed
calculation
is
a
sub-problem
of
a
larger
calculation.
Bottom-up
dynamic
programming
involves
formulating
a
complex
calculation
as
a
recursive
series
of
simpler
calculations.
