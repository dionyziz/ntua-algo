In
mathematics
and
computer
science,
dynamic
programming
is
a
method
for
solving
complex
problems
by
breaking
them
down
into
simpler
subproblems.
It
is
applicable
to
problems
exhibiting
the
properties
of
overlapping
subproblems
which
are
only
slightly
smaller
and
optimal
substructure
(described
below).
When
applicable,
the
method
takes
far
less
time
than
naive
methods.
The
key
idea
behind
dynamic
programming
is
quite
simple.
In
general,
to
solve
a
given
problem,
we
need
to
solve
different
parts
of
the
problem
(subproblems),
then
combine
the
solutions
of
the
subproblems
to
reach
an
overall
solution.
Often,
many
of
these
subproblems
are
really
the
same.
The
dynamic
programming
approach
seeks
to
solve
each
subproblem
only
once,
thus
reducing
the
number
of
computations.
This
is
especially
useful
when
the
number
of
repeating
subproblems
is
exponentially
large.
Top-down
dynamic
programming
simply
means
storing
the
results
of
certain
calculations,
which
are
later
used
again
since
the
completed
calculation
is
a
sub-problem
of
a
larger
calculation.
Bottom-up
dynamic
programming
involves
formulating
a
complex
calculation
as
a
recursive
series
of
simpler
calculations.
The
term
dynamic
programming
was
originally
used
in
the
1940s
by
Richard
Bellman
to
describe
the
process
of
solving
problems
where
one
needs
to
find
the
best
decisions
one
after
another.
By
1953,
he
refined
this
to
the
modern
meaning,
referring
specifically
to
nesting
smaller
decision
problems
inside
larger
decisions,
and
the
field
was
thereafter
recognized
by
the
IEEE
as
a
systems
analysis
and
engineering
topic.
Bellman's
contribution
is
remembered
in
the
name
of
the
Bellman
equation,
a
central
result
of
dynamic
programming
which
restates
an
optimization
problem
in
recursive
form.
The
word
dynamic
was
chosen
by
Bellman
to
capture
the
time-varying
aspect
of
the
problems,
and
also
because
it
sounded
impressive.
The
word
programming
referred
to
the
use
of
the
method
to
find
an
optimal
program,
in
the
sense
of
a
military
schedule
for
training
or
logistics.
This
usage
is
the
same
as
that
in
the
phrases
linear
programming
and
mathematical
programming,
a
synonym
for
mathematical
optimization.
